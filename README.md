## Overview

### About this version of Telegram-tracker

**telegram-tracker** is an excellent implementation for extracting information from Telegram channels. However, it does not retain context of what has been downloaded, which makes it challenging to automatically update channels with the latest messages. The lack of context can lead to message repetitions if a channel is downloaded more than once.

This version of telegram-tracker aims to download messages from Telegram channels and keep them updated with new messages, **avoiding duplicates**. To achieve this, it **maintains context** for each download by recording the date and time, the most recent message, and the total number of downloaded messages. It also stores context for all downloaded channels and their related channels.

Usually, a download can take many hours or even days. If the scripts are interrupted, following this procedure ensures a safer restart, preventing the storage of repeated messages.

This version stores only the most relevant data directly in CSV. This dramatically reduces data storage by not storing JSON. It also reduces execution time by not having to convert JSON to CSV, which was a very time-consuming process.

### Changes introduced in this Telegram-tracker fork

-   **Corrections**:

    -   Fix a warning about using a deprecated parameter
    -   Fixed some download errors with exceptions

-   **Changes**

    -   Store data directly in csv, selecting only the relevant data

    -   Added a **download progress bar**. Some channels can have millions of messages and it was not known how much was left to download. This progress bar takes as the number of messages the number of the last published message (the message ids are consecutive numbers starting from 1). The channel may have deleted messages, the download percentage will rarely reach 100%, but it gives an idea of ​​the percentage of deleted messages

    -   The file **related_channels.csv** with the names of the related channels has been added to the download directory

    -   The script **build-datasets.py** has been removed since the data is collected directly in csv.

    -   The **--min-id parameter** has been removed as it is no longer necessary, given that updates with new messages are now automatic.

    -   The **--batch-file** parameter has been removed to ensure that channels are downloaded one by one using **main.py**. When you want to download a list of channels, you can do so using:

        -   A shell script **menu.py**
        -   The **telegram-tracker.ipynb** notebook included in this repository, prepared to be used in **Google's Colab environment**

-   **Added context**:

    -   The **context** directory has been created to store the different download logs
    -   The **{channel}\_log_download.csv** file has been added to the **context** directory. For each download, the most recent message number, the number of downloaded messages, and the date and time of the download are stored. This allows automatic updating of new messages without having to use the **--min-id** parameter which has been removed.
    -   For **snowball downloading**, context is saved in a file **{channel}\_n2_log.csv** with the operations carried out by the channels in order to resume the download at the point it left off after an interruption
    -   To **download a list** of channels, context is saved in a file **{name_list}\_log.csv** with the operations carried out by the channels in order to resume the download at the point it left off after an interruption
    -   In the **context** directory of the data, two files have been added:
        -   **collected_channels_all.csv**: contains all the downloaded channels
        -   **related_channel_all.csv**: includes all channels related to the downloaded channels. These channels may appear in multiple datasets, which is why we also store the number of times they appear in other downloads and the directories where they can be found.

-   **Limitations**: There are two types of channels:

    -   **Broadcasts** that publish and do not allow comments. It only has one owner
    -   **Chat channels** allow conversations and usually have several administrators

    Chat channels can have millions of messages and downloading them requires a lot of time and storage. It is possible to limit the number of messages with the parameter **--max_msgs** and the most recent ones are obtained.

This fork includes a notebook to run these scripts in the colab environment.

Requirements:

-   Have a Google account
-   Have a Telegram account
-   Create an App in Telegram <https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps> and follow the steps to obtain the Id and API KEY
-   Fill the telegram-tracker configuration file (config/config.ini) with the App data
-   Upload the repository to drive
-   Open **telegram-tracker.ipynb** in the colab environment (clicking on the notebook will open it in the environment)

The **telegram-tracker.ipynb** notebook will mount drive so that the scripts can be executed from there

### Local enviroment

This tool connects to Telegram's API. It generates JSON files containing channel's data, including channel's information and posts. You can search for a specific channel, or a set of channels provided in a text file (one channel per line.)

You can access it in command mode, but with the **menu.py** script you can download in a controlled way

```

<br />

## **Examples**

<br />

### **Basic request**

```         
python main.py --telegram-channel channelname`
```

**Expected output**

-   Files of collected channels:
    -   chats.txt
    -   collected_chats.csv
    -   user_exceptions.txt
    -   counter.csv
    -   collected_chanels

<br />

### **Request using a text file containing a set of channels**

Download the channels one by one with the same output directory

```         
for chanel in channels:
   python main.py  --telegram-channel channel --output './path/to/channels'
```

**Expected output**

-   Files of collected channels:
    -   chats.txt
    -   collected_chats.csv
    -   user_exceptions.txt
    -   counter.csv
    -   collected_chanels
-   New folders - based on the number of requested channels: <channel_name> containing
    -   A JSON file containing channel's profile metadata
    -   A JSON file containing posts from the requested channel
    -   log_downloads.csv

These examples will retrieve all posts available through the API from the requested channel. If you want to collect channel's information only, without posts, you can run:

<br />

### **Limit download to channel's metadata only**

```         
python main.py --telegram-channel channelname --limit-download-to-channel-metadata
```

<br />

### **Updating channel's data**

It is automatic because it has context

```         
python main.py --telegram-channel channelname --output './path/to/channels'
```

**Expected output**

-   Files of collected channels:
    -   chats.txt
    -   collected_chats.csv
    -   user_exceptions.txt
    -   counter.csv
    -   collected_chanels

<br />

### **Specify output folder**

The script allows you to specify a specific output directory to save collected data. The sxcript will create those folders in case do not exist.

```         
python main.py --telegram-channel channelname --output ./path/to/chosen/directory`
```

The expected output is the same a described above but data will be save using the chosen directory.

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `channels-to-network.py`

This Python script builds a network graph. By default, the file will be located in the `output` folder. The script also saves a preliminary graph: `network.png` using the modules matplotlib, networkx, and python-louvain, which implements community detection. You can import the GEFX Graph File using different softwares, including Gephi.

### Options

-   `--data-path` Path were data is located. Will use `./output/data` if not given.

If a specific directory was not provided in `main.py`, run:

```         
python channels-to-network.py
```

If you provided a specific directory using the option `--output` in `main.py`, run:

```         
python channels-to-network.py --data-path ./path/to/chosen/directory
```
